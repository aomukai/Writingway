- [ ] Update developer documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples

### 3. Refinement
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] UI/UX improvements based on feedback
- [ ] Bug fixes and stability improvements

## Phase 6: Release Preparation (Week 6)

### 1. Final Testing
- [ ] Regression testing
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing
- [ ] Final user acceptance testing

### 2. Release
- [ ] Version bump
- [ ] Release notes
- [ ] Deployment

## Dependencies and Considerations

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing LLM infrastructure must be stable
- SettingsManager needs to support preset storage
- UI components must be extensible

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement in phases to allow for feedback
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Thoroughly test rate limiting with real providers
- Handle errors gracefully to prevent application crashes

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize memory usage during batch generation
- Efficiently handle large numbers of requests
- Avoid blocking UI during long operations
- Cache provider model lists to reduce API calls

## Success Criteria

1. Users can configure and run batch generation with multiple models
2. Results are automatically evaluated and ranked by a judge model
3. Rate limits are respected and errors are handled gracefully
4. Presets can be saved, loaded, and managed
5. UI is responsive and provides clear feedback during operation
6. Feature is well-documented and easy to use

texts of Kabbalah\nwithin the realm of\nJewish tradition\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nand often use classical Jewish scriptures to explain and demonstrate its mystical teachings. Kabbalists hold these teachings to define the inner meaning of both the\nHebrew Bible\nand traditional\nrabbinic literature\nand their formerly concealed transmitted dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish religious observances.\n[\n4\n]\nHistorically, Kabbalah emerged from earlier forms of\nJewish mysticism\n, in 12th- to 13th-century\nal-Andalus (Spain)\nand in\nHakhmei Provence\n,\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nand was reinterpreted during the Jewish mystical renaissance in 16th-century\nOttoman Palestine\n.\n[\n2\n]\nThe\nZohar\n, the foundational text of Kabbalah, was authored in the late 13th century, likely by\nMoses de León\n.\nIsaac Luria\n(16th century) is considered the father of contemporary Kabbalah; Lurianic Kabbalah was popularised in the form of\nHasidic Judaism\nfrom the 18th century onwards.\n[\n2\n]\nDuring the 20th century, academic interest in Kabbalistic texts led primarily by the Jewish historian\nGershom Scholem\nhas inspired the development of\nhistorical research on Kabbalah\nin the field of\nJudaic studies\n.\n[\n5\n]\n[\n6\n]\nThough minor works contribute to an understanding of the Kabbalah as an evolving tradition, the primary texts are the\nBahir\n,\nZohar\n,\nPardes Rimonim\n,\nand\nEtz Chayim ('Ein Sof')\n.\n[\n7\n]\nThe early\nHekhalot literature\nis acknowledged as ancestral to the sensibilities of this later flowering of the Kabbalah\n[\n8\n]\nand more especially the\nSefer Yetzirah\nis acknowledged as the antecedent from which all these books draw many of their formal inspirations. The\nSefer Yetzirah\nis a brief document of only few pages that was written many centuries before the\nhigh\nand\nlate medieval\nworks (sometime between 200-600CE), detailing an alphanumeric vision of cosmology—may be understood as a kind of prelude to the canon of Kabbalah.\n[\n7\n]\nHistory of Jewish mysticism\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nHistory of Jewish mysticism\nJewish mysticism\nHistory of Jewish mysticism\nForms\nProphets\n800–400s BCE\nApocalyptic literature\n300–100 BCE\nPardes\nRabbinic esotericism\nc. 1 – 200 CE\nMerkabah\n-\nHekhalot\nc. 100 BCE – 1000 CE\nPractical Kabbalah\nearly CE–modernity\nSefer Yetzirah\n200–600 CE\nAshkenazi Hasidim\nc. 1150 – 1250 CE\nMedieval Kabbalah\nEcstatic Kabbalah\nc. 1175 – 1500s CE\nZohar\n1280s–1400s CE\nCordoverian Kabbalah\n1500s CE\nLurianic Kabbalah\n1570 CE – today\nSabbatean sects\n1665 – c. 1800 CE\nHasidism\nHasidic schools\n1730s CE – today\nAcademic study\nc. 1920s – today\nv\nt\ne\nThe history of Jewish mysticism encompasses various forms of\nesoteric\nand spiritual practices aimed at understanding the divine and the hidden aspects of existence.\n[\n9\n]\n[\nb\n]\nThis mystical tradition has evolved significantly over millennia, influencing and being influenced by different historical, cultural, and religious contexts. Among the most prominent forms of Jewish mysticism is Kabbalah, which emerged in the 12th century and has since become a central component of Jewish mystical thought. Other notable early forms include prophetic and apocalyptic mysticism, which are evident in biblical and post-biblical texts.\nThe roots of Jewish mysticism can be traced back to the biblical era, with prophetic figures such as\nElijah\nand\nEzekiel\nexperiencing divine visions and encounters.\n[\n10\n]\nThis tradition continued into the apocalyptic period, where texts like\n1 Enoch\nand the\nBook of Daniel\nintroduced complex angelology and eschatological themes.\n[\n11\n]\nThe\nHekhalot\nand\nMerkabah\nliterature, dating from the 2nd century to the early medieval period, further developed these mystical themes, focusing on visionary ascents to the heavenly palaces and the divine chariot.\n[\n12\n]\nThe medieval period saw the formalization of Kabbalah, particularly in southern France and Spain. Foundational texts such as the\nBahir\nand the\nZohar\nwere composed during this time, laying the groundwork for later developments.\n[\n13\n]\nThe Kabbalistic teachings of this era delved deeply into the nature of the divine, the structure of the universe, and the process of creation. Notable Kabbalists like\nMoses de León\nplayed crucial roles in disseminating these teachings, which were characterized by their profound symbolic and allegorical interpretations of the Torah.\nIn the early modern period,\nLurianic Kabbalah\n, founded by\nIsaac Luria\nin the 16th century, introduced new metaphysical concepts such as\nTzimtzum\n(divine contraction) and\nTikkun\n(cosmic repair), which have had a lasting impact on Jewish thought.\n[\n14\n]\nThe 18th century saw the rise of\nHasidism\n, a movement that integrated Kabbalistic ideas into a popular, revivalist context, emphasizing personal mystical experience and the presence of the divine in everyday life.\n[\n15\n]\nTraditions\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nEcstatic Kabbalah\nand\nPractical Kabbalah\nAccording to the\nZohar\n, a foundational text for kabbalistic thought,\n[\n16\n]\nTorah study\ncan proceed along four levels of interpretation (\nexegesis\n).\n[\n17\n]\n[\n18\n]\nThese four levels are called\npardes\nfrom their initial letters (PRDS\nפַּרדֵס\n‎\n, 'orchard'):\nPeshat\n(Hebrew:\nפשט\nlit.\n'\nsimple\n'\n): the direct interpretations of meaning.\n[\n19\n]\nRemez\n(\nרֶמֶז\n‎\nlit.\n'\nhint[s]\n'\n): the\nallegoric\nmeanings (through\nallusion\n).\nDerash\n(\nדְרָשׁ\n‎\nfrom the Hebrew\ndarash\n: 'inquire' or 'seek'):\nmidrashic\n(rabbinic) meanings, often with imaginative comparisons with similar words or verses.\nSod\n(\nסוֹד\n,\nlit.\n'\nsecret\n'\nor\n'\nmystery\n'\n): the inner, esoteric (\nmetaphysical\n) meanings, expressed in kabbalah.\nKabbalah is considered by its followers as a necessary part of the study of\nTorah\n– the study of Torah (the\nTanakh\nand rabbinic literature) being an inherent duty of observant Jews.\n[\n20\n]\nModern academic-historical study of Jewish mysticism reserves the term\nkabbalah\nto designate the particular, distinctive doctrines that textually emerged fully expressed in the Middle Ages, as distinct from the earlier\nMerkabah mystical concepts\nand methods.\n[\n21\n]\nAccording to this descriptive categorization, both versions of Kabbalistic theory, the medieval-Zoharic and the early-modern\nLurianic Kabbalah\ntogether comprise the Theosophical tradition in Kabbalah, while the\nMeditative\n-\nEcstatic Kabbalah\nincorporates a parallel inter-related Medieval tradition. A third tradition, related but more shunned, involves the magical aims of\nPractical Kabbalah\n.\nMoshe Idel\n, for example, writes that these 3 basic models can be discerned operating and competing throughout the whole history of Jewish mysticism, beyond the particular Kabbalistic background of the Middle Ages.\n[\n22\n]\nThey can be readily distinguished by their basic intent with respect to God:\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe Theosophical or Theosophical-\nTheurgic\ntradition of Theoretical Kabbalah (the main focus of the\nZohar\nand Luria) seeks to understand and describe the divine realm using the imaginative and mythic symbols of human psychological experience. As an intuitive conceptual alternative to rationalist\nJewish philosophy\n, particularly\nMaimonides\n' Aristotelianism, this speculation became the central stream of Kabbalah, and the usual reference of the term\nkabbalah\n. Its\ntheosophy\nalso implies the innate, centrally important theurgic influence of human conduct on redeeming or damaging the spiritual realms, as man is a divine microcosm, and the spiritual realms the divine macrocosm. The purpose of traditional theosophical kabbalah was to give the whole of normative\nJewish religious\npractice this mystical metaphysical meaning.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe\nMeditative\ntradition of\nEcstatic Kabbalah\n(exemplified by\nAbraham Abulafia\nand\nIsaac of Acre\n) strives to achieve a mystical union with God, or nullification of the meditator in God's\nActive intellect\n. Abraham Abulafia's \"Prophetic Kabbalah\" was the supreme example of this, though marginal in Kabbalistic development, and his alternative to the program of theosophical Kabbalah. Abulafian meditation built upon the philosophy of Maimonides, whose following remained the\nrationalist threat\nto theosophical Kabbalists.\n[\n23\n]\nThe\nMagico-Talismanic\ntradition of\nPractical Kabbalah\n(in often unpublished manuscripts) endeavours to alter both the Divine realms and the World using\npractical methods\n. While theosophical interpretations of worship see its redemptive role as harmonising heavenly forces, Practical Kabbalah properly involved\nwhite-magical\nacts, and was censored by Kabbalists for only those completely pure of intent, as it relates to lower realms where purity and impurity are mixed. Consequently, it formed a separate minor tradition shunned from Kabbalah. Practical Kabbalah was prohibited by the Arizal until the\nTemple in Jerusalem\nis rebuilt and the required state of ritual purity is attainable.\n[\n24\n]\nAccording to Kabbalistic belief, early kabbalistic knowledge was transmitted orally by the Patriarchs,\nprophets\n, and sages, eventually to be \"interwoven\" into Jewish religious writings and culture.\n[\n25\n]\nAccording to this view, early kabbalah was, in around the 10th century BCE, an open knowledge practiced by over a million people in ancient Israel.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nForeign conquests drove the Jewish spiritual leadership of the time (the\nSanhedrin\n) to hide the knowledge and make it secret, fearing that it might be misused if it fell into the wrong hands.\n[\n28\n]\nIt is hard to clarify with any degree of certainty the exact concepts within kabbalah. There are several different schools of thought with very different outlooks; however, all are accepted as correct.\n[\n29\n]\nModern\nhalakhic\nauthorities have tried to narrow the scope and diversity within kabbalah, by restricting study to certain texts, notably\nZohar\nand the teachings of Isaac Luria as passed down through\nHayyim ben Joseph Vital\n.\n[\n30\n]\nHowever, even this qualification does little to limit the scope of understanding and expression, as included in those works are commentaries on Abulafian writings,\nSefer Yetzirah\n, Albotonian writings, and the\nBerit Menuhah\n,\n[\n31\n]\nwhich is known to the kabbalistic elect and which, as described more recently by\nGershom Scholem\n, combined ecstatic with theosophical mysticism. It is therefore important to bear in mind when discussing things such as the\nsephirot\nand their interactions that one is dealing with highly abstract concepts that at best can only be understood intuitively.\n[\n32\n]\nJewish and non-Jewish Kabbalah\n[\nedit\n]\nSee also:\nChristian Cabala\nand\nHermetic Qabalah\nFrom the\nRenaissance\nonwards Jewish Kabbalah texts entered non-Jewish culture, where they were studied and translated by\nChristian Hebraists\nand\nHermetic\noccultists.\n[\n33\n]\nThe syncretic traditions of\nChristian Cabala\nand\nHermetic Qabalah\ndeveloped independently of Judaic Kabbalah, reading the Jewish texts as universalist ancient wisdom preserved from the\nGnostic\ntraditions of antiquity.\n[\n34\n]\nBoth adapted the Jewish concepts freely from their Jewish understanding, to merge with multiple other theologies, religious traditions and magical associations. With the decline of Christian Cabala in the\nAge of Reason\n, Hermetic Qabalah continued as a central underground tradition in\nWestern esotericism\n. Through these non-Jewish associations with magic,\nalchemy\nand divination, Kabbalah acquired some popular\noccult\nconnotations forbidden within Judaism, where Jewish Practical Kabbalah was a minor, permitted tradition restricted for a few elite. Today, many publications on Kabbalah belong to the non-Jewish\nNew Age\nand occult traditions of Cabala, rather than giving an accurate picture of Judaic Kabbalah.\n[\n35\n]\nInstead, academic and traditional Jewish publications now translate and study Judaic Kabbalah for wide readership.\nConcepts\n[\nedit\n]\nThe definition of Kabbalah varies according to the tradition and aims of those following it.\n[\n36\n]\nAccording to its earliest and original usage in ancient Hebrew it means 'reception' or 'tradition', and in this context it tends to refer to any sacred writing composed after (or otherwise outside of) the five books of the Torah.\n[\n37\n]\nAfter the Talmud is written, it refers to the Oral Law (both in the sense of the 'Talmud' itself and in the sense of continuing dialog and thought devoted to the scripture in every generation).\n[\n37\n]\nIn the much later writings of Eleazar of Worms (c. 1350), it refers to\ntheurgy\nor the conjuring of demons and angels by the invocation of their secret names.\n[\n37\n]\nThe understanding of the word Kabbalah undergoes a transformation of its meaning in medieval Judaism, in the books which are now primarily referred to as 'the Kabbalah': the\nBahir\n, the\nZohar\n,\nEtz Hayim\netc.\n[\n37\n]\nIn these books the word Kabbalah is used in manifold new senses. During this major phase it refers to the continuity of revelation in every generation, on the one hand, while also suggesting the necessity of revelation to remain concealed and secret or esoteric in every period by formal requirements native to sacred truth.\n[\n37\n]\nWhen the term Kabbalah is used to refer to a canon of secret mystical books by medieval Jews, these aforementioned books and other works in their constellation are the books and the literary sensibility to which the term refers.\n[\n37\n]\nEven later the word is adapted or appropriated in\nWestern esotericism\n(\nChristian Kabbalah\nand\nHermetic Qabalah\n), where it influences the tenor and aesthetics of European occultism practiced by gentiles or non-Jews. But above all, Jewish Kabbalah is a set of sacred and magical teachings meant to explain the relationship between the unchanging, eternal\nGod\n—the mysterious\nEin Sof\n(\nאֵין סוֹף\n‎\n, 'The Infinite')\n[\n38\n]\n[\n39\n]\n—and the mortal, finite\nuniverse\n(God's\ncreation\n).\n[\n2\n]\n[\n38\n]\nConcealed and revealed God\n[\nedit\n]\nMetaphorical scheme of emanated spiritual worlds within the\nEin Sof\nSee also:\nAtzmus\nand\nAnthropomorphism in Kabbalah\nThe nature of the divine prompted kabbalists to envision two aspects to God: (a) God in essence, absolutely\ntranscendent\n, unknowable, limitless\ndivine simplicity\nbeyond revelation, and (b) God in manifestation, the revealed persona of God through which he creates and sustains and relates to humankind. Kabbalists speak of the first as\nEin/Ayn Sof\n(אין סוף \"the infinite/endless\", literally \"there is no end\"). Of the impersonal\nEin Sof\nnothing can be grasped. However, the second aspect of divine emanations, accessible to human perception, dynamically interacting throughout spiritual and physical existence, reveal the divine\nimmanently\n, and are bound up in the life of man. Kabbalists believe that these two aspects are not contradictory but complement one another, emanations\nmystically\nrevealing the concealed mystery from within the\nGodhead\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAs a term describing the Infinite Godhead beyond Creation, Kabbalists viewed the\nEin Sof\nitself as too sublime to be referred to directly in the Torah. It is not a\nHoly Name in Judaism\n, as no name could contain a revelation of the Ein Sof. Even terming it \"No End\" is an inadequate representation of its true nature, the description only bearing its designation in relation to Creation. However, the Torah does narrate God speaking in the first person, most memorably the first word of the\nTen Commandments\n, a reference without any description or name to the simple\nDivine essence\n(termed also\nAtzmus Ein Sof\n– Essence of the Infinite) beyond even the duality of Infinitude/Finitude. In contrast, the term Ein Sof describes the Godhead as Infinite lifeforce first cause, continuously keeping all Creation in existence. The\nZohar\nreads the\nfirst words of Genesis\n,\nBeReishit Bara Elohim – In the beginning God created\n, as \"\nWith\n(the level of)\nReishit (Beginning)\n(the Ein Sof)\ncreated\nElohim\n(God's manifestation in creation)\":\n[\n40\n]\nAt the very beginning the King made engravings in the supernal purity. A spark of blackness emerged in the sealed within the sealed, from the mystery of the Ayn Sof, a mist within matter, implanted in a ring, no white, no black, no red, no yellow, no colour at all. When He measured with the standard of measure, He made colours to provide light. Within the spark, in the innermost part, emerged a source, from which the colours are painted below; it is sealed among the sealed things of the mystery of Ayn Sof. It penetrated, yet did not penetrate its air. It was not known at all until, from the pressure of its penetration, a single point shone, sealed, supernal. Beyond this point nothing is known, so it is called\nreishit\n(beginning): the first word of all ...\nThe structure of emanations has been described in various ways:\nSephirot\n(divine attributes) and\nPartzufim\n(divine \"faces\"),\nOhr\n(spiritual light and flow),\nNames of God\nand the supernal\nTorah\n,\nOlamot\n(Spiritual Worlds), a\nDivine Tree\nand\nArchetypal Man\n,\nAngelic Chariot and Palaces\n, male and female, enclothed layers of reality, inwardly holy vitality and external Kelipot shells,\n613 channels\n(\"limbs\" of the King) and the divine Souls of\nMan\n. These symbols are used to describe various levels and aspects of Divine manifestation, from the\nPnimi\n(inner) dimensions to the\nHitzoni\n(outer).\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nIt is solely in relation to the emanations, certainly not the\nEin Sof\nGround of all Being, that Kabbalah uses\nanthropomorphic symbolism\nto relate psychologically to divinity. Kabbalists debated the validity of anthropomorphic symbolism, between its disclosure as mystical allusion, versus its instrumental use as allegorical metaphor; in the language of the Zohar, symbolism \"touches yet does not touch\" its point.\n[\n41\n]\n[\nnon-primary source needed\n]\nSephirot\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nSefirot\nScheme of descending\nSephirot\nin three columns, as a tree with roots above and branches below\nThe\nSephirot\n(also spelled \"sefirot\"; singular\nsefirah\n) are the ten emanations and attributes of God with which he continually sustains the existence of the universe. These emanations are viewed as parts of God's divine nature, which reveal themselves in different ways. The Zohar and other Kabbalistic texts elaborate on the emergence of the sephirot from a state of concealed potential in the\nEin Sof\nuntil their manifestation in the mundane world. In particular, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (known as \"the Ramak\"), describes how God emanated the myriad details of finite reality out of the absolute unity of Divine light via the ten sephirot, or vessels.\n[\n42\n]\nTen sephirot as process of creation\n[\nedit\n]\nAccording to Lurianic cosmology, the\nsephirot\ncorrespond to various levels of creation (ten\nsephirot\nin each of the Four Worlds, and four worlds within each of the larger four worlds, each containing ten\nsephirot\n, which themselves contain ten\nsephirot\n, to an infinite number of possibilities),\n[\n43\n]\nand are emanated from the Creator for the purpose of creating the universe. The\nsephirot\nare considered revelations of the Creator's will (\nratzon\n),\n[\n44\n]\nand they should not be understood as ten different \"gods\" but as ten different ways the one God reveals his will through the Emanations. It is not God who changes but the ability to perceive God that changes.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nTen Sephirot as process of ethics\n[\nedit\n]\nIn the 16–17th centuries Kabbalah was popularised through a new genre of ethical literature, related to Kabbalistic meditation\nDivine creation by means of the Ten Sephirot is an ethical process. They represent the different aspects of Morality. Loving-Kindness is a possible moral justification found in Chessed, and Gevurah is the Moral Justification of Justice and both are mediated by Mercy which is Rachamim. However, these pillars of morality become immoral once they become extremes. When Loving-Kindness becomes extreme it can lead to sexual depravity and lack of Justice to the wicked. When Justice becomes extreme, it can lead to torture and the Murder of innocents and unfair punishment.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\n\"Righteous\" humans (\ntzadikim\nplural of\nTzadik\n) ascend these ethical qualities of the ten\nsephirot\nby doing righteous actions. If there were no righteous humans, the blessings of God would become completely hidden, and creation would cease to exist. While real human actions are the \"Foundation\" (\nYesod\n) of this universe (\nMalchut\n), these actions must accompany the conscious intention of compassion. Compassionate actions are often impossible without faith (\nEmunah\n), meaning to trust that God always supports compassionate actions even when God seems hidden. Ultimately, it is necessary to show compassion toward oneself too in order to share compassion toward others. This \"selfish\" enjoyment of God's blessings but only in order to empower oneself to assist others is an important aspect of \"Restriction\", and is considered a kind of\ngolden mean\nin kabbalah, corresponding to the\nsefirah\nof Adornment (\nTiferet\n) being part of the \"Middle Column\".\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMoses ben Jacob Cordovero, wrote\nTomer Devorah\n(\nPalm Tree of Deborah\n), in which he presents an ethical teaching of Judaism in the kabbalistic context of the ten\nsephirot\n.\nTomer Devorah\nhas become also a foundational\nMusar text\n.\n[\n45\n]\nPartzufim\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nPartzufim\nThe most esoteric\nIdrot\nsections of the classic Zohar make reference to\nhypostatic\nmale and female\nPartzufim\n(Divine Personas) displacing the Sephirot, manifestations of God in particular\nAnthropomorphic\nsymbolic personalities based on\nBiblical esoteric exegesis\nand\nmidrashic\nnarratives. Lurianic Kabbalah places these at the centre of our existence, rather than earlier Kabbalah's Sephirot, which Luria saw as broken in Divine crisis. Contemporary cognitive understanding of the Partzuf symbols relates them to\nJungian archetypes\nof the\ncollective unconscious\n, reflecting a psychologised progression from youth to sage in therapeutic healing back to the infinite Ein Sof/Unconscious, as Kabbalah is simultaneously both\ntheology\nand\npsychology\n.\n[\n46\n]\nDescending spiritual worlds\n[\nedit\n]\nMain articles:\nFour Worlds\nand\nSeder hishtalshelus\nMedieval Kabbalists believed that all things are linked to God through these\nemanations\n, making all levels in creation part of one great, gradually descending\nchain of being\n. Through this any lower creation reflects its particular roots in supernal divinity. Kabbalists agreed with the\ndivine transcendence\ndescribed by\nJewish philosophy\n, but as only referring to the\nEin Sof\nunknowable Godhead. They reinterpreted the\ntheistic\nphilosophical concept of creation from nothing, replacing God's creative act with\npanentheistic\ncontinual self-emanation by the mystical\nAyin\nNothingness/No-thing sustaining all spiritual and physical realms as successively more corporeal garments, veils and condensations of\ndivine immanence\n. The innumerable levels of descent divide into\nFour comprehensive spiritual worlds\n,\nAtziluth\n(\"Closeness\" – Divine Wisdom),\nBeriah\n(\"Creation\" – Divine Understanding),\nYetzirah\n(\"Formation\" – Divine Emotions),\nAssiah\n(\"Action\" – Divine Activity), with a preceding Fifth World\nAdam Kadmon\n(\"Primordial Man\" – Divine Will) sometimes excluded due to its sublimity. Together the whole spiritual heavens form the Divine Persona/\nAnthropos\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nHasidic thought extends the divine immanence of Kabbalah by holding that God is all that really exists, all else being completely undifferentiated from God's perspective. This view can be defined as\nacosmic\nmonistic\npanentheism. According to this philosophy, God's existence is higher than anything that this world can express, yet he includes all things of this world within his divine reality in perfect unity, so that the creation effected no change in him at all. This paradox as seen from dual human and divine perspectives is dealt with at length in\nChabad texts\n.\n[\n47\n]\nOrigin of evil\n[\nedit\n]\nAmulet\nfrom the 15th century. Theosophical kabbalists, especially Luria, censored contemporary Practical Kabbalah, but allowed amulets by Sages\n[\n48\n]\nAmong problems considered in the Hebrew Kabbalah is the theological issue of the nature and origin of evil. In the views of some Kabbalists this conceives \"evil\" as a \"quality of God\", asserting that negativity enters into the essence of the Absolute. In this view it is conceived that the Absolute needs evil to \"be what it is\", i.e., to exist.\n[\n49\n]\nFoundational texts of Medieval Kabbalism conceived evil as a demonic parallel to the holy, called the\nSitra Achra\n(the \"Other Side\"), and the\nqlippoth\n(the \"shells/husks\") that cover and conceal the holy, are nurtured from it, and yet also protect it by limiting its revelation. Scholem termed this element of the Spanish Kabbalah a \"Jewish gnostic\" motif, in the sense of dual powers in the divine realm of manifestation. In a radical notion, the root of evil is found within the 10 holy Sephirot, through an imbalance of\nGevurah\n, the power of \"Strength/Judgement/Severity\".\n[\n50\n]\nGevurah is necessary for Creation to exist as it counterposes\nChesed\n(\"loving-kindness\"), restricting the unlimited divine bounty within suitable vessels, so forming the Worlds. However, if man sins (actualising impure judgement within his soul), the supernal Judgement is reciprocally empowered over the Kindness, introducing disharmony among the Sephirot in the divine realm and exile from God throughout Creation. The demonic realm, though illusory in its holy origin, becomes the real apparent realm of impurity in lower Creation. In the\nZohar\n, the sin of Adam and Eve (who embodied\nAdam Kadmon\nbelow) took place in the spiritual realms. Their sin was that they separated the\nTree of knowledge\n(10\nsefirot\nwithin\nMalkuth\n, representing\nDivine immanence\n), from the\nTree of life\nwithin it (10 sefirot within\nTiferet\n, representing\nDivine transcendence\n). This introduced the false perception of duality into lower creation, an external\nTree of Death\nnurtured from holiness, and an\nAdam Belial\nof impurity.\n[\n51\n]\nIn Lurianic Kabbalah, evil originates from a primordial shattering of the sephirot of God's Persona before creation of the\nstable spiritual worlds\n, mystically represented by the 8\nKings of Edom\n(the derivative of\nGevurah\n) \"who died\" before any king reigned in Israel from\nGenesis 36\n. In the divine view from above within Kabbalah, emphasised in\nHasidic\nPanentheism\n, the appearance of duality and pluralism below dissolves into the absolute\nMonism\nof God, psychologising evil.\n[\n52\n]\nThough impure below, what appears as evil derives from a divine blessing too high to be contained openly.\n[\n53\n]\nThe mystical task of the\nrighteous\nin the Zohar is to reveal this concealed Divine Oneness and absolute good, to \"convert bitterness into sweetness, darkness into light\".\n[\nThis quote needs a citation\n]\nRole of Man\n[\nedit\n]\nJoseph Karo\n's role as both legalist and mystic underscores Kabbalah's spiritualisation of normative Jewish observance\nKabbalistic doctrine gives man the central role in Creation, as his soul and body correspond to the supernal divine manifestations. In the Christian Kabbalah this scheme was universalised to describe\nharmonia mundi\n, the harmony of Creation within man.\n[\n54\n]\nIn Judaism, it gave a profound spiritualisation of Jewish practice. While the kabbalistic scheme gave a radically innovative, though conceptually continuous, development of mainstream Midrashic and Talmudic rabbinic notions, kabbalistic thought underscored and invigorated conservative Jewish observance. The esoteric teachings of kabbalah gave the traditional mitzvot observances the central role in spiritual creation, whether the practitioner was learned in this knowledge or not. Accompanying normative Jewish observance and worship with elite mystical kavanot intentions gave them\ntheurgic\npower, but sincere observance by common folk, especially in the Hasidic popularisation of kabbalah, could replace esoteric abilities. Many kabbalists were also leading legal figures in Judaism, such as Nachmanides and\nJoseph Karo\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMedieval kabbalah elaborates particular reasons for each Biblical\nmitzvah\n, and their role in harmonising the supernal divine flow, uniting masculine and feminine forces on High. With this, the feminine Divine presence in this world is drawn from exile to the Holy One Above. The\n613 mitzvot\nare embodied in the organs and soul of man. Lurianic Kabbalah incorporates this in the more inclusive scheme of Jewish messianic rectification of exiled divinity. Jewish mysticism, in contrast to Divine transcendence rationalist human-centred reasons for Jewish observance, gave Divine-immanent providential cosmic significance to the daily events in the worldly life of man in general, and the spiritual role of Jewish observance in particular.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nLevels of the soul\n[\nedit\n]\nBuilding on Kabbalah's conception of the soul,\nAbraham Abulafia\n's meditations included the \"inner illumination of\" the human form\n[\n55\n]\nThe Kabbalah posits that the human soul has three elements: the\nnefesh\n,\nru'ach\n, and\nneshamah\n. The\nnefesh\nis found in all humans, and enters the physical body at birth. It is the source of one's physical and psychological nature. The next two parts of the soul are not implanted at birth, but can be developed over time; their development depends on the actions and beliefs of the individual. They are said to only fully exist in people awakened spiritually. A common way of explaining the three parts of the soul is as follows:\n[\n56\n]\nNefesh\n(נֶפֶשׁ): the lower part, or \"animal part\", of the soul. It is linked to instincts and bodily cravings. This part of the soul is provided at birth.\nRuach\n(רוּחַ): the middle soul, the \"spirit\". It contains the moral virtues and the ability to distinguish between good and evil.\nNeshamah\n(נְשָׁמָה): the higher soul, or \"super-soul\". This separates man from all other life-forms. It is related to the intellect and allows man to enjoy and benefit from the afterlife. It allows one to have some awareness of the existence and presence of God.\nChayyah\n(חיה): The part of the soul that allows one to have an awareness of the divine life force itself.\nYehidah\n(יחידה): The highest plane of the soul, in which one can achieve as full a union with God as is possible.\nReincarnation\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nGilgul\nReincarnation\n, the transmigration of the soul after death, was introduced into Judaism as a central esoteric tenet of Kabbalah from the Medieval period onwards, called Gilgul neshamot (\"cycles of the soul\"). The concept does not appear overtly in the Hebrew Bible or classic rabbinic literature, and was rejected by various Medieval Jewish philosophers. However, the Kabbalists explained a number of scriptural passages in reference to Gilgulim. The concept became central to the later Kabbalah of Isaac Luria, who systemised it as the personal parallel to the cosmic process of rectification. Through Lurianic Kabbalah and Hasidic Judaism, reincarnation entered popular Jewish culture as a literary motif.\n[\n57\n]\nTzimtzum, Shevirah and Tikkun\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nLurianic Kabbalah\n16th-century graves of\nSafed\n,\nGalilee\n. The messianic focus of its mystical renaissance culminated in Lurianic thought.\nTzimtzum\n(Constriction/Concentration) is the primordial cosmic act whereby God \"contracted\" His infinite light, leaving a \"void\" into which the light of existence was poured. This allowed the emergence of independent existence that would not become nullified by the pristine Infinite Light, reconciling the unity of the\nEin Sof\nwith the plurality of creation. This changed the first creative act into one of withdrawal/exile, the antithesis of the ultimate Divine Will. In contrast, a new emanation after the Tzimtzum shone into the vacuum to begin creation, but led to an initial instability called\nTohu\n(Chaos), leading to a new crisis of\nShevirah\n(Shattering) of the sephirot vessels. The shards of the broken vessels fell down into the lower realms, animated by remnants of their divine light, causing primordial exile within the Divine Persona before the creation of man. Exile and enclothement of higher divinity within lower realms throughout existence requires man to complete the\nTikkun olam\n(Rectification) process. Rectification Above corresponds to the reorganization of the independent sephirot into relating\nPartzufim\n(Divine Personas), previously referred to obliquely in the Zohar. From the catastrophe stems the possibility of self-aware Creation, and also the\nKelipot\n(Impure Shells) of previous Medieval kabbalah. The metaphorical\nanthropomorphism\nof the partzufim accentuates the sexual unifications of the redemption process, while\nGilgul\nreincarnation emerges from the scheme. Uniquely, Lurianism gave formerly private mysticism the urgency of Messianic social involvement.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAccording to interpretations of Luria, the catastrophe stemmed from the \"unwillingness\" of the residue imprint after the Tzimtzum to relate to the new vitality that began creation. The process was arranged to shed and harmonise the Divine Infinity with the latent potential of evil.\n[\n58\n]\nThe creation of\nAdam\nwould have redeemed existence, but his sin caused new shevirah of Divine vitality, requiring the Giving of the Torah to begin Messianic rectification. Historical and individual history becomes the narrative of reclaiming exiled Divine sparks.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nLinguistic mysticism and the mystical Torah\n[\nedit\n]\nKabbalistic thought extended\nBiblical\nand\nMidrashic\nnotions that God enacted Creation through the Hebrew language and through the\nTorah\ninto a full linguistic mysticism.\n[\n59\n]\nIn this, every Hebrew letter, word, number, even accent on words of the Hebrew Bible contain\nJewish mystical meanings\n, describing the spiritual dimensions within exoteric ideas, and it teaches the\nhermeneutic\nmethods of interpretation for ascertaining these meanings.\nNames of God in Judaism\nhave further prominence, though infinite meaning turns the whole Torah into a Divine name. As the Hebrew name of things is the channel of their lifeforce, parallel to the sephirot, so concepts such as \"holiness\" and \"\nmitzvot\n\" embody ontological Divine immanence, as God can be known in manifestation as well as transcendence. The infinite potential of meaning in the Torah, as in the\nEin Sof\n, is reflected in the symbol of the two trees of the Garden of Eden; the Torah of the\nTree of Knowledge\nis the external, finite\nHalachic\nTorah, enclothed within which the mystics perceive the unlimited infinite plurality of meanings of the Torah of the\nTree of Life\n. In Lurianic terms, each of the 600,000 root souls of Israel find their own interpretation in Torah, as \"God, the Torah and Israel are all One\".\n[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nThe reapers of the Field are the Comrades, masters of this wisdom, because\nMalkhut\nis called the Apple Field, and She grows sprouts of secrets and new meanings of Torah. Those who constantly create new interpretations of Torah are the ones who reap Her.\n[\n61\n]\nAs early as the 1st century BCE Jews believed that the Torah and other canonical texts contained encoded messages and hidden meanings.\n[\n62\n]\nGematria\nis one method for discovering its hidden meanings. In this system, each Hebrew letter also represents a number. By converting letters to numbers, Kabbalists were able to find a hidden meaning in each word. This method of interpretation was used extensively by various schools.\n[\n63\n]\nIn contemporary interpretation of kabbalah, Sanford Drob makes cognitive sense of this linguistic mythos by relating it to\npostmodern philosophical\nconcepts described by\nJacques Derrida\nand others, where all reality embodies narrative texts with infinite plurality of meanings brought by the reader. In this dialogue, kabbalah survives the nihilism of\nDeconstruction\nby incorporating its own Lurianic\nShevirah\n, and by the dialectical paradox where man and God imply each other.\n[\n64\n]\nCognition, mysticism, or values\n[\nedit\n]\nKabbalists as mystics\n[\nedit\n]\nA\nswastika\ncomposed of Hebrew letters as a mystical symbol from the Jewish Kabbalistic work\nParashat Eliezer\n, from the 18th century or earlier\nThe founder of the academic study of Jewish mysticism,\nGershom Scholem\n, privileged an intellectual view of the nature of Kabbalistic\nsymbols\nas\ndialectic\nTheosophical\nspeculation. In contrast, contemporary scholarship of\nMoshe Idel\nand\nElliot R. Wolfson\nhas opened a\nphenomenological\nunderstanding of the\nmystical\nnature of Kabbalistic experience, based on a close reading of the historical texts. Wolfson has shown that among the closed elite circles of mystical activity, medieval Theosophical Kabbalists held that an intellectual view of their symbols was secondary to the experiential. In the context of medieval\nJewish philosophical\ndebates on the role of imagination in Biblical prophecy, and essentialist versus instrumental kabbalistic debates about the relation of\nsephirot\nto God, they saw\ncontemplation on the sephirot\nas a vehicle for prophecy. Judaism's ban on physical iconography, along with anthropomorphic metaphors for Divinity in the\nHebrew Bible\nand\nmidrash\n, enabled their internal visualisation of the Divine sephirot Anthropos in imagination. Disclosure of the aniconic in iconic internal psychology, involved sublimatory revelation of Kabbalah's sexual unifications. Previous academic distinction between\nTheosophical\nversus Abulafian\nEcstatic-Prophetic Kabbalah\noverstated their division of aims, which revolved around visual versus verbal/auditory views of prophecy.\n[\n65\n]\nIn addition, throughout the history of Judaic Kabbalah, the greatest mystics claimed to receive new teachings from\nElijah the Prophet\n, the souls of earlier sages (a purpose of\nLurianic meditation\nprostrated on the graves of Talmudic\nTannaim\n,\nAmoraim\nand Kabbalists), the soul of the\nmishnah\n, ascents during sleep, heavenly messengers, etc. A tradition of\nparapsychology\nabilities,\npsychic\nknowledge, and\ntheurgic\nintercessions in heaven for the community is recounted in the\nhagiographic\nworks\nPraises of\nthe Ari\n,\nPraises of the\nBesht\n, and in many other Kabbalistic and\nHasidic\ntales. Kabbalistic and\nHasidic\ntexts are concerned to apply themselves from\nexegesis\nand theory to spiritual practice, including\nprophetic\ndrawing of new mystical revelations in Torah. The mythological symbols Kabbalah uses to answer philosophical questions, themselves invite\nmystical\ncontemplation,\nintuitive\napprehension and\npsychological\nengagement.\n[\n66\n]\nParadoxical coincidence of opposites\n[\nedit\n]\nIn bringing Theosophical Kabbalah into contemporary intellectual understanding, using the tools of modern and postmodern\nphilosophy\nand\npsychology\n, Sanford Drob shows philosophically how every symbol of the Kabbalah embodies the simultaneous\ndialectical\nparadox of mystical\nCoincidentia oppositorum\n, the conjoining of two opposite dualities.\n[\n67\n]\nThus the Infinite\nEin Sof\nis above the duality of\nYesh/Ayin\nBeing/Non-Being\ntranscending Existence/Nothingness (\nBecoming\ninto Existence through the souls of Man who are the inner dimension of all spiritual and physical worlds, yet simultaneously the Infinite Divine generative lifesource beyond Creation that continuously keeps everything spiritual and physical in existence);\nSephirot\nbridge the philosophical problem of the One and the Many; Man is both Divine (\nAdam Kadmon\n) and human (invited to project human psychology onto Divinity to understand it);\nTzimtzum\nis both illusion and real from Divine and human perspectives; evil and good imply each other (\nKelipah\ndraws from Divinity, good arises only from overcoming evil); Existence is simultaneously partial (Tzimtzum), broken (\nShevirah\n), and whole (\nTikun\n) from different perspectives; God experiences Himself as Other through Man, Man embodies and completes (Tikun) the Divine Persona Above. In Kabbalah's reciprocal\nPanentheism\n,\nTheism\nand\nAtheism\n/\nHumanism\nrepresent two incomplete poles of a mutual dialectic that imply and include each other's partial validity.\n[\n64\n]\nThis was expressed by the\nChabad\nHasidic thinker\nAaron of Staroselye\n, that the truth of any concept is revealed only in its opposite.\nMetaphysics or axiology\n[\nedit\n]\nThey wish to convey here that if arms were a disgrace to the hero, it would not have used them as a\nparable\nfor words of Torah. Instead, they are an adornment for him, so the verse used them for its parable, saying that he should have words of Torah and wisdom in hand, like the sword on the hero’s thigh, girded and accessible to him whenever he wishes to unsheathe it and use it to overpower his fellow—this is his glory and splendor. This is the idea wherever they expound a midrashic parable or\nallegory\n; they believe that both\n“the internal and external” are true\n[\n68\n]\n—\nNahmanides\nBy expressing itself using\nsymbols\nand\nmyth\nthat transcend single interpretations, Theosophical Kabbalah incorporates aspects of\nphilosophy\n, Jewish\ntheology\n,\npsychology\nand unconscious\ndepth psychology\n,\nmysticism\nand\nmeditation\n,\nJewish exegesis\n,\ntheurgy\n, and\nethics\n, as well as overlapping with theory from\nmagical elements\n. Its symbols can be read as questions which are their own\nexistentialist\nanswers (the Hebrew sephirah\nChokmah\n-Wisdom, the beginning of Existence, is read etymologically by Kabbalists as the question \"Koach Mah?\" the \"Power of What?\"). Alternative listings of the\nSephirot\nstart with either\nKeter\n(Unconscious Will/Volition), or Chokmah (Wisdom), a philosophical duality between a Rational or Supra-Rational Creation, between whether the\nMitzvot\nJudaic observances have reasons or transcend reasons in Divine Will, between whether\nstudy or good deeds\nis superior, and whether the symbols of Kabbalah should be read as primarily\nmetaphysical\nintellectual cognition or\nAxiology\nvalues. Messianic redemption requires both ethical\nTikkun olam\nand contemplative\nKavanah\n. Sanford Drob sees every attempt to limit Kabbalah to one fixed dogmatic interpretation as necessarily bringing its own\nDeconstruction\n(Lurianic Kabbalah incorporates its own\nShevirah\nself shattering; the\nEin Sof\ntranscends all of its infinite expressions; the infinite mystical Torah of the\nTree of Life\nhas no/infinite interpretations).

Classic mystical Bible commentaries are included in fuller versions of the\nMikraot Gedolot\n(Main Commentators). Cordoveran systemisation is presented in\nPardes Rimonim\n, philosophical articulation in the works of the\nMaharal\n, and Lurianic rectification in\nEtz Chayim\n. Subsequent interpretation of Lurianic Kabbalah was made in the writings of Shalom Sharabi, in\nNefesh HaChaim\nand the 20th-century\nSulam\n. Hasidism interpreted kabbalistic structures to their correspondence in inward perception.\n[\n70\n]\nThe Hasidic development of kabbalah incorporates a successive stage of Jewish mysticism from historical kabbalistic metaphysics.\n[\n71\n]\nScholarship\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nList of Jewish mysticism scholars\nThe first modern-academic historians of Judaism, the \"\nWissenschaft des Judentums\n\" school of the 19th century, framed Judaism in solely rational terms in the emancipatory Haskalah spirit of their age. They opposed kabbalah and restricted its significance from Jewish historiography. In the mid-20th century, it was left to\nGershom Scholem\nto overturn their stance, establishing the flourishing present-day academic investigation of Jewish mysticism, and making Heichalot, Kabbalistic and Hasidic texts the objects of scholarly critical-historical study. In Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components of Judaism were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the exoteric\nHalakha\nor intellectualist\nJewish philosophy\n, were the living subterranean stream in historical Jewish development that periodically broke out to renew the Jewish spirit and social life of the community. Scholem's magisterial\nMajor Trends in Jewish Mysticism\n(1941) among his seminal works, though representing scholarship and interpretations that have subsequently been challenged and revised within the field,\n[\n72\n]\nremains the only academic survey studying all main historical periods of\nJewish mysticism\n.\n[\ndubious\n–\ndiscuss\n]\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe\nHebrew University of Jerusalem\nhas been a centre of this research, including Scholem and\nIsaiah Tishby\n, and more recently\nJoseph Dan\n,\nYehuda Liebes\n,\nRachel Elior\n, and\nMoshe Idel\n.\n[\n73\n]\nScholars across the eras of Jewish mysticism in America and Britain have included\nAlexander Altmann\n,\nArthur Green\n,\nLawrence Fine\n,\nElliot Wolfson\n,\nDaniel Matt\n,\n[\n74\n]\nLouis Jacobs\nand\nAda Rapoport-Albert\n.\nMoshe Idel has opened up research on the Ecstatic Kabbalah alongside the theosophical, and has called for new multi-disciplinary approaches, beyond the philological and historical that have dominated until now, to include\nphenomenology\n,\npsychology\n,\nanthropology\nand\ncomparative studies\n.\n[\n75\n]\nClaims for authority\n[\nedit\n]\nHistorians have noted that most claims for the authority of kabbalah involve an argument of the antiquity of authority.\n[\n76\n]\nAs a result, virtually all early foundational works\npseudepigraphically\nclaim, or are ascribed, ancient authorship. For example,\nSefer Raziel HaMalach\n, an astro-magical text partly based on a magical manual of late antiquity,\nSefer ha-Razim\n, was, according to the kabbalists, transmitted by the angel\nRaziel\nto Adam after he was evicted from Eden. Another famous work, the early\nSefer Yetzirah\n, is dated back to the patriarch\nAbraham\n.\n[\n77\n]\nThis tendency toward pseudepigraphy has its roots in apocalyptic literature, which claims that esoteric knowledge such as magic, divination and astrology was transmitted to humans in the mythic past by the two angels, Aza and\nAzaz'el\n(in other places, Azaz'el and Uzaz'el) who fell from heaven (see Genesis 6:4).\nAs well as ascribing ancient origins to texts, and reception of\nOral Torah\ntransmission, the greatest and most innovative Kabbalists claimed mystical reception of direct personal divine revelations, by heavenly mentors such as\nElijah the Prophet\n, the souls of\nTalmudic sages\n,\nprophetic revelation\n, soul ascents on high, etc. On this basis\nArthur Green\nspeculates, that while the\nZohar\nwas written by a circle of Kabbalists in medieval Spain, they may have believed they were channeling the souls and direct revelations from the earlier mystic circle of\nShimon bar Yochai\nin 2nd century Galilee depicted in the Zohar's narrative.\n[\n78\n]\nAcademics have compared the Zohar mystic circle of Spain with the romanticised wandering mystic circle of Galilee described in the text. Similarly,\nIsaac Luria\ngathered his disciples at the traditional\nIdra\nassembly location, placing each in the seat of their former reincarnations as students of Shimon bar Yochai.\nCriticism\n[\nedit\n]\nThis article is of a series on\nCriticism of religion\nBy religion\nBaháˈí Faith\nBuddhism\nChristianity\nCatholic\nJehovah's Witnesses\nLatter Day Saint movement\nProtestantism\nSeventh-day Adventist\nUnification movement\nUnification Church in Japan\nWestboro Baptist Church\nHinduism\nSwaminarayan sect\nIslam\nIslamism\nTwelver Shia Islam\nWahhabism\nJainism\nJudaism\nMonotheism\nNew religious movement\nNeopaganism\nScientology\nSikhism\nYazdânism\nZoroastrianism\nBy religious figure\nAisha\nCharles Taze Russell\nEllen White\nJesus\nMoses\nMuhammad\nMirza Ghulam Ahmad\nSaul\nBy text\nBible\nQuran\nHadith\nMormon sacred texts\nBook of Mormon\nTalmud\nReligious violence\nBuddhism\nChristianity\nMormonism\nJudaism\nIslam\nTerrorism\nChristian\nHindu\nIslamic\nJewish\nPersecution\nChristian thought on persecution and tolerance\nWar\nIn Islam\nIn Judaism\nSectarian violence\nBy country\nIndia\nAnti-Christian violence\nIn Odisha\nNigeria\nPakistan\nBibliographies\nChristianity\nIslam\nJudaism\nMormonism\nScientology\nRelated topics\nAbuse\nApostasy\nIn Islam\nIn Christianity\nCriticism of atheism\nCriticism of monotheism\nSexuality\nSlavery\nSuperstitions\nMuslim\nJewish\nv\nt\ne\nDistinction between Jews and non-Jews\n[\nedit\n]\nOne point of view is represented by the Hasidic work\nTanya\n(1797), in order to argue that Jews have a different character of soul: while a non-Jew, according to the author\nShneur Zalman of Liadi\n(1745–1812), can achieve a high level of spirituality, similar to an angel, his soul is still fundamentally different in character, from a Jewish one.\n[\n79\n]\nA similar view is found in\nKuzari\n, an early medieval philosophical book by\nYehuda Halevi\n(1075–1141).\n[\n80\n]\nAnother rabbi,\nAbraham Yehudah Khein\n(1878–1957), believed that spiritually elevated Gentiles have essentially Jewish souls, \"who just lack the formal conversion to Judaism\", and that unspiritual Jews are \"Jewish merely by their birth documents\".\n[\n81\n]\nDavid Halperin argues that the collapse of Kabbalah's influence among Western European Jews over the course of the 17th and 18th century was a result of the\ncognitive dissonance\nthey experienced between the negative perception of Gentiles found in some exponents of Kabbalah, and their own positive dealings with non-Jews, which were rapidly expanding and improving during this period due to the influence of\nthe Enlightenment\n.\n[\n82\n]\nPinchas Elijah Hurwitz\n, a Lithuanian-Galician Kabbalist of the 18th century and a moderate proponent of the Haskalah, called for brotherly love and solidarity between all nations, and believed that Kabbalah can empower everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, with prophetic abilities.\n[\n83\n]\nThe works of\nAbraham Cohen de Herrera\n(1570–1635) are full of references to Gentile mystical philosophers. Such approach was particularly common among the\nRenaissance\nand post-Renaissance\nItalian Jews\n. Late medieval and Renaissance Italian Kabbalists, such as\nYohanan Alemanno\n,\nDavid Messer Leon\nand\nAbraham Yagel\n, adhered to humanistic ideals and incorporated teachings of various Christian and\npagan\nmystics.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nA prime representative of this humanist stream in Kabbalah was\nElijah Benamozegh\n, who explicitly praised Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, as well as a whole range of ancient pagan mystical systems. He believed that Kabbalah can reconcile the differences between the world's religions, which represent different facets and stages of the universal human spirituality. In his writings, Benamozegh interprets the\nNew Testament\n,\nHadith\n,\nVedas\n,\nAvesta\nand pagan mysteries according to the Kabbalistic theosophy.\n[\n84\n]\nE. R. Wolfson provides numerous examples from the 17th to the 20th centuries, which would challenge the view of Halperin as well as the notion that \"modern Judaism\" has rejected or dismissed this \"outdated aspect\" of the religion and, he argues, there are still Kabbalists today who harbor this view. He argues that, while it is accurate to say that many Jews do and would find this distinction offensive, it is inaccurate to say that the idea has been totally rejected in all circles. As Wolfson has argued, it is an ethical demand on the part of scholars to continue to be vigilant with regard to this matter and in this way the tradition can be refined from within.\n[\n85\n]\nMedieval views\n[\nedit\n]\nGolden age of Spanish Judaism\non the\nKnesset Menorah\n,\nMaimonides\nholding\nAristotle\n's work\nKabbalah mysticism on the\nKnesset Menorah\n, which shared some similarities of theory with Jewish Neoplatonists\nThe idea that there are ten divine\nsephirot\ncould evolve over time into the idea that \"God is One being, yet in that One being there are Ten\" which opens up a debate about what the \"correct beliefs\" in God should be, according to Judaism. The early Kabbalists debated the relationship of the Sephirot to God, adopting a range of essentialist versus instrumental views.\n[\n25\n]\nModern Kabbalah, based on the 16th century systemisations of\nCordovero\nand\nIsaac Luria\n, takes an intermediate position: the instrumental vessels of the sephirot are created, but their inner light is from the undifferentiated\nOhr Ein Sof\nessence.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nMaimonides\n(12th century), celebrated by followers for his\nJewish rationalism\n, rejected many of the pre-Kabbalistic\nHekalot\ntexts, particularly\nShi'ur Qomah\nwhose starkly anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical.\n[\n86\n]\nMaimonides, a centrally important medieval sage of Judaism, lived at the time of the first emergence of Kabbalah. Modern scholarship views the systemisation and publication of their historic oral doctrine by Kabbalists, as a move to rebut the threat on\nJudaic observance\nby the populance misreading Maimonides' ideal of philosophical contemplation over ritual performance in his philosophical\nGuide for the Perplexed\n. They objected to Maimonides equating the Talmudic\nMaaseh Breishit and Maaseh Merkavah\nsecrets of the Torah with\nAristotelean\nphysics and metaphysics in that work and in his legal\nMishneh Torah\n, teaching that their own Theosophy, centred on an esoteric metaphysics of traditional Jewish practice, is the Torah's true inner meaning.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe Kabbalist\nmedieval rabbinic sage\nNachmanides\n(13th century), classic debater against Maimonidean rationalism, provides background to many kabbalistic ideas. An entire book entitled\nGevuras Aryeh\nwas authored by\nYaakov Yehuda Aryeh Leib Frenkel\nand originally published in 1915, specifically to explain and elaborate on the kabbalistic concepts addressed by Nachmanides in his classic\ncommentary to the Five books of Moses\n.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAbraham Maimonides\n(in the spirit of his father Maimonides,\nSaadiah Gaon\n, and other predecessors) explains at length in his\nMilḥamot HaShem\nthat God is in no way literally within time or space nor physically outside time or space, since time and space simply do not apply to his being whatsoever, emphasizing the\nMonotheist\nOneness of\nDivine transcendence\nunlike any worldly conception. Kabbalah's\nPanentheism\nexpressed by\nMoses Cordovero\nand\nHasidic thought\n, agrees that God's essence transcends all expression, but holds in contrast that existence is a manifestation of God's Being, descending\nimmanently\nthrough spiritual and physical condensations of the divine light. By incorporating the pluralist many within God, God's Oneness is deepened to exclude the true existence of anything but God. In\nHasidic Panentheism\n, the world is\nacosmic\nfrom the Divine view, yet real from its own perspective.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAround the 1230s,\nRabbi Meir ben Simon of Narbonne\nwrote an epistle (included in his\nMilḥemet Mitzvah\n) against his contemporaries, the early Kabbalists, characterizing them as blasphemers who even approach heresy. He particularly singled out the Sefer Bahir, rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the\ntanna\nR. Neḥunya ben ha-Kanah\nand describing some of its content as truly heretical.\n[\n25\n]\nKabbalistic\nprayer book\nfrom\nItaly\n, 1803.\nJewish Museum of Switzerland\n,\nBasel\nLeon of Modena\n, a 17th-century\nVenetian\ncritic of Kabbalah, wrote that if we were to accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would be compatible with Judaism, as the Trinity seems to resemble the kabbalistic doctrine of the\nsephirot\n. This was in response to the belief that some European Jews of the period addressed individual\nsephirot\nin their prayers, although the practice was apparently uncommon. Apologists explained that Jews may have been praying\nfor\nand not necessarily\nto\nthe aspects of Godliness represented by the\nsephirot\n. In contrast to Christianity, Kabbalists declare that one prays only \"to Him (\nGod's Essence\n, male solely by metaphor in Hebrew's gendered grammar), not to his attributes (sephirot or any other Divine manifestations or forms of incarnation)\". Kabbalists directed their prayers to God's essence through the channels of particular sephirot using\nkavanot\nDivine names\nintentions. To pray to a manifestation of God introduces false division among the sephirot, disrupting their absolute unity, dependence and dissolving into the transcendent\nEin Sof\n; the sephirot descend throughout Creation, only appearing from man's perception of God, where God manifests by any variety of numbers.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nYaakov Emden\n(1697–1776), himself an Orthodox Kabbalist who venerated the\nZohar\n,\n[\n87\n]\nconcerned to battle\nSabbatean\nmisuse of Kabbalah, wrote the\nMitpaḥath Sfarim\n(\nVeil of the Books\n), an astute critique of the\nZohar\nin which he concludes that certain parts of the Zohar contain heretical teaching and therefore could not have been written by Shimon bar Yochai.\n[\n87\n]\nVilna Gaon\n(1720–1797) held the Zohar and Luria in deep reverence, critically emending classic Judaic texts from historically accumulated errors by his acute acumen and scholarly belief in the perfect unity of Kabbalah revelation and Rabbinic Judaism. Though a Lurianic Kabbalist, his commentaries sometimes chose Zoharic interpretation over Luria when he felt the matter lent itself to a more exoteric view. Although proficient in mathematics and sciences and recommending their necessity for understanding\nTalmud\n, he had no use for canonical medieval\nJewish philosophy\n, declaring that\nMaimonides\nhad been \"misled by the accursed philosophy\" in denying belief in the external\noccult matters\nof demons, incantations and amulets.\n[\n88\n]\nViews of Kabbalists regarding\nJewish philosophy\nvaried from those who appreciated\nMaimonidean\nand other classic medieval philosophical works, integrating them with Kabbalah and seeing profound human philosophical and Divine kabbalistic wisdoms as compatible, to those who polemicised against religious philosophy during times when it became overly rationalist and dogmatic. A dictum commonly cited by Kabbalists, \"Kabbalah begins where Philosophy ends\", can be read as either appreciation or polemic. Moses of Burgos (late 13th century) declared, \"these philosophers whose wisdom you are praising end where we begin\".\n[\n89\n]\nMoses Cordovero\nappreciated the influence of Maimonides in his quasi-rational systemisation.\n[\n90\n]\nFrom its inception, the Theosophical Kabbalah became permeated by terminology adapted from philosophy and given new mystical meanings, such as its early integration with the Neoplatonism of\nIbn Gabirol\nand use of Aristotelian terms of Form over Matter.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nOrthodox Judaism\n[\nedit\n]\nTikkun for reading through the night of\nShavuot\n, a popular Jewish custom from the Safed Kabbalists\nPinchas Giller and\nAdin Steinsaltz\nwrite that Kabbalah is best described as the inner part of traditional\nJewish religion\n, the official\nmetaphysics\nof Judaism, that was essential to normative Judaism until fairly recently.\n[\n91\n]\n[\n92\n]\nWith the decline of Jewish life in\nmedieval Spain\n, it displaced rationalist\nJewish philosophy\nuntil the modern rise of Haskalah enlightenment, receiving a revival in our\npostmodern\nage. While Judaism always maintained a minority tradition of religious rationalist criticism of Kabbalah,\nGershom Scholem\nwrites that Lurianic Kabbalah was the last theology that was near predominant in Jewish life. While Lurianism represented the elite of esoteric Kabbalism, its mythic-messianic divine drama and personalisation of\nreincarnation\ncaptured the popular imagination in\nJewish folklore\nand in the\nSabbatean\nand\nHasidic\nsocial movements.\n[\n93\n]\nGiller notes that the former\nZoharic\n-\nCordoverian\nclassic Kabbalah represented a common exoteric popular view of Kabbalah, as depicted in early modern\nMusar literature\n.\n[\n94\n]\nIn contemporary\nOrthodox Judaism\nthere is dispute as to the status of the Zohar's and Isaac Luria's (the\nArizal\n) Kabbalistic teachings. While a portion of\nModern Orthodox\n, followers of the\nDor De'ah\nmovement, and many students of the\nRambam\nreject Arizal's Kabbalistic teachings, as well as deny that the\nZohar\nis authoritative or from\nShimon bar Yohai\n, all three of these groups accept the existence and validity of the Talmudic\nMaaseh Breishit and Maaseh Merkavah\nmysticism. Their disagreement concerns whether the Kabbalistic teachings promulgated today are accurate representations of those esoteric teachings to which the Talmud refers. The mainstream\nHaredi\n(\nHasidic\n,\nLithuanian\n,\nOriental\n) and\nReligious Zionist\nJewish movements revere Luria and the Kabbalah, but one can find both rabbis who sympathize with such a view, while disagreeing with it,\n[\n95\n]\nas well as rabbis who consider such a view heresy. The Haredi\nEliyahu Dessler\nand\nGedaliah Nadel\nmaintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.\n[\n96\n]\nYechiel Yaakov Weinberg\nmentioned the possibility of Christian influence in the Kabbalah with the \"Kabbalistic vision of the Messiah as the redeemer of all mankind\" being \"the Jewish counterpart to Christ.\"\n[\n97\n]\nModern Orthodox Judaism\n, representing an inclination to rationalism, embrace of academic scholarship, and the individual's autonomy to define Judaism, embodies a diversity of views regarding Kabbalah from a\nNeo-Hasidic\nspirituality to\nMaimonist\nanti-Kabbalism. In a book to help define central theological issues in Modern Orthodoxy, Michael J. Harris writes that the relationship between Modern Orthodoxy and mysticism has been under-discussed. He sees a deficiency of spirituality in Modern Orthodoxy, as well as the dangers in a fundamentalist adoption of Kabbalah. He suggests the development of neo-Kabbalistic adaptions of Jewish mysticism compatible with rationalism, offering a variety of precedent models from past thinkers ranging from the mystical inclusivism of\nAbraham Isaac Kook\nto a compartmentalisation between Halakha and mysticism.\n[\n98\n]\nYiḥyeh Qafeḥ\n, a 20th-century\nYemenite Jewish\nleader and Chief Rabbi of Yemen, spearheaded the\nDor De'ah\n(\"generation of knowledge\") movement\n[\n99\n]\nto counteract the influence of the Zohar and modern Kabbalah.\n[\n100\n]\nHe authored critiques of mysticism in general and Lurianic Kabbalah in particular; his magnum opus was Milḥamoth ha-Shem (\nWars of Hashem\n)\n[\n101\n]\nagainst what he perceived as\nneo-platonic\nand gnostic influences on Judaism with the publication and distribution of the Zohar since the 13th Century. Rabbi Yiḥyah founded\nyeshivot\n, rabbinical schools, and synagogues that featured a rationalist approach to Judaism based on the Talmud and works of Saadia Gaon and Maimonides (Rambam). In recent years, rationalists holding similar views as those of the Dor De'ah movement have described themselves as \"talmide ha-Rambam\" (disciples of Maimonides) rather than as being aligned with Dor De'ah, and are more theologically aligned with the rationalism of\nModern Orthodox Judaism\nthan with Orthodox\nḤasidic\nor\nḤaredi\ncommunities.\n[\n102\n]\nYeshayahu Leibowitz\n(1903–1994), an ultra-rationalist Modern Orthodox philosopher, referred to Kabbalah \"a collection of \"pagan superstitions\" and \"idol worship\" in remarks given in 1990.\n[\n103\n]\nConservative, Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism\n[\nedit\n]\nA version of\nLekhah Dodi\nsong to welcome the\nShabbat\n, a cross denomination Jewish custom from Kabbalah\nKabbalah tended to be rejected by most Jews in the Conservative and\nReform\nmovements, though its influences were not eliminated. While it was generally not studied as a discipline, the Kabbalistic\nKabbalat Shabbat\nservice remained part of liberal liturgy, as did the\nYedid Nefesh\nprayer. Nevertheless, in the 1960s,\nSaul Lieberman\nof the\nJewish Theological Seminary of America\nis reputed to have introduced a lecture by Scholem on Kabbalah with a statement that Kabbalah itself was \"nonsense\", but the academic study of Kabbalah was \"scholarship\". This view became popular among many Jews, who viewed the subject as worthy of study, but who did not accept Kabbalah as teaching literal truths.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAccording to\nBradley Shavit Artson\n(Dean of the Conservative\nZiegler School of Rabbinic Studies\n):\nMany western Jews insisted that their future and their freedom required shedding what they perceived as parochial orientalism. They fashioned a Judaism that was decorous and strictly rational (according to 19th-century European standards), denigrating Kabbalah as backward, superstitious, and marginal.\n[\n104\n]\nHowever, in the late 20th century and early 21st century there has been a revival in interest in Kabbalah in all branches of liberal Judaism. The Kabbalistic 12th-century prayer\nAnim Zemirot\nwas restored to the new Conservative\nSim Shalom\nsiddur\n, as was the\nB'rikh Shmeh\npassage from the Zohar, and the mystical\nUshpizin\nservice welcoming to the\nSukkah\nthe spirits of Jewish forebears.\nAnim Zemirot\nand the 16th-century mystical poem\nLekhah Dodi\nreappeared in the Reform Siddur\nGates of Prayer\nin 1975. All rabbinical seminaries now teach several courses in Kabbalah—in\nConservative Judaism\n, both the\nJewish Theological Seminary of America\nand the\nZiegler School of Rabbinic Studies\nof the\nAmerican Jewish University\nin Los Angeles have full-time instructors in Kabbalah and\nHasidut\n, Eitan Fishbane and Pinchas Giller, respectively. In Reform Judaism, Sharon Koren teaches at the\nHebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion\n. Reform rabbis like Herbert Weiner and\nLawrence Kushner\nhave renewed interest in Kabbalah among Reform Jews. At the\nReconstructionist Rabbinical College\n, Joel Hecker is the full-time instructor teaching courses in Kabbalah and Hasidut.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAccording to Artson:\nOurs is an age hungry for meaning, for a sense of belonging, for holiness. In that search, we have returned to the very Kabbalah our predecessors scorned. The stone that the builders rejected has become the head cornerstone (Psalm 118:22)... Kabbalah was the last universal theology adopted by the entire Jewish people, hence faithfulness to our commitment to positive-historical Judaism mandates a reverent receptivity to Kabbalah.\n[\n105\n]\nThe\nReconstructionist\nmovement, under the leadership of Arthur Green in the 1980s and 1990s, and with the influence of Zalman Schachter Shalomi, brought a strong openness to Kabbalah and hasidic elements that then came to play prominent roles in the Kol ha-Neshamah siddur series.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nAntinomian Kabbalah\n[\nedit\n]\nAntinomian\nstrands of Kabbalah reject or invert normal religious principles as a way of attempting purification. In these frameworks, transgression or sin itself is viewed as a spiritual necessity, capable of unleashing hidden divine sparks trapped in impure realms. The most prominent antinomian movements within Judaism were the\nSabbateans\nand the\nFrankists\n.\n[\n106\n]\n[\n107\n]\nFollowers of\nSabbatai Zevi\nbelieved that the coming of the messiah rendered\nJewish commandments\nobsolete, with some sects engaging in ritualistic violations of the Law.\n[\n108\n]\n[\n109\n]\nMany of his adherents continued to view his actions as part of a hidden divine plan. In the 18th century,\nJacob Frank\npushed this theology further, advocating explicitly for \"redemption through sin,\" such as\nritualized orgies\nand\nincest\n.\n[\n110\n]\n[\n111\n]\n[\n112\n]\nEventually, the Frankists were encouraged to mass convert into\nCatholicism\n.\n[\n113\n]\n[\n114\n]\nThese movements were widely condemned as heretical but demonstrate the extent to which mystical ideas could support radical or subversive, reinterpretations of Jewish life.\n[\n109\n]\nContemporary study\n[\nedit\n]\nTeaching of classic esoteric kabbalah texts and practice remained traditional until recent times, passed on in Judaism from master to disciple, or studied by leading rabbinic scholars. This changed in the 20th century, through conscious reform and the secular openness of knowledge. In contemporary times kabbalah is studied in four very different, though sometimes overlapping, ways.\nThe traditional method, employed among Jews since the 16th century, continues in learned study circles. Its prerequisite is to either be born Jewish or be a convert and to join a group of kabbalists under the tutelage of a rabbi, since the 18th century more likely a Hasidic one, though others exist among Sephardi-Mizrachi, and Lithuanian rabbinic scholars. Beyond elite, historical esoteric kabbalah, the public-communally studied texts of Hasidic thought explain kabbalistic concepts for wide spiritual application, through their own concern with popular psychological perception of Divine Panentheism.\n[\n50\n]\nA second, new\nuniversalist\nform, is the method of modern-style Jewish organisations and writers, who seek to disseminate kabbalah to every man, woman and child regardless of race or class, especially since the Western interest in mysticism from the 1960s. These derive from various cross-denominational Jewish interests in kabbalah, and range from considered theology to popularised forms that often adopt New Age terminology and beliefs for wider communication. These groups highlight or interpret kabbalah through non-particularist, universalist aspects.\n[\n115\n]\nA third way is non-Jewish organisations, mystery schools, initiation bodies, fraternities and\nsecret societies\n, the most popular of which are\nFreemasonry\n,\nRosicrucianism\nand the\nGolden Dawn\n, although hundreds of similar societies claim a kabbalistic lineage. These derive from\nsyncretic\ncombinations of Jewish kabbalah with Christian, occultist or contemporary\nNew Age\nspirituality. As a separate spiritual tradition in Western esotericism since the Renaissance, with different aims from its Jewish origin, the non-Jewish traditions differ significantly and do not give an accurate representation of the Jewish spiritual understanding (or vice versa).\n[\n116\n]\nFourthly, since the mid-20th century,\nhistorical-critical\nscholarly investigation of all eras of Jewish mysticism has flourished into an established department of university\nJewish studies\n. Where the first academic historians of Judaism in the 19th century opposed and marginalised kabbalah, Gershom Scholem and his successors repositioned the historiography of Jewish mysticism as a central, vital component of Judaic renewal through history. Cross-disciplinary academic revisions of Scholem's and others' theories are regularly published for a wide readership.\n[\n117\n]\nUniversalist Jewish organisations\n[\nedit\n]\nIn recent decades, Kabbalah has seen a resurgence of interest, with several modern groups and individuals exploring its profound teachings. These contemporary interpretations of Kabbalah offer a fresh perspective on this ancient mystical tradition, often bridging the gap between traditional wisdom and modern thought. Some of these interpretations emphasize universalist and philosophical approaches, seeking to enrich secular disciplines through the lens of Kabbalistic insights. Others have gained attention for their unique blends of spirituality and popular culture, attracting followers from diverse backgrounds. These modern expressions of Kabbalah showcase its enduring appeal and relevance in today's world.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nBnei Baruch\nis a group of Kabbalah students, based in Israel. Study materials are available in over 25 languages for free online or at printing cost. Michael Laitman established Bnei Baruch in 1991, following the passing of his teacher, Ashlag's son Rav\nBaruch Ashlag\n. Laitman named his group Bnei Baruch (sons of Baruch) to commemorate the memory of his mentor. The teaching strongly suggests restricting one's studies to 'authentic sources', kabbalists of the direct lineage of master to disciple.\n[\n118\n]\n[\n119\n]\nThe\nKabbalah Centre\nwas founded in the United States in 1965 as The National Research Institute of Kabbalah by\nPhilip Berg\nand Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, disciple of Yehuda Ashlag's. Later Philip Berg and his wife re-established the organisation as the worldwide Kabbalah Centre.\n[\n120\n]\n[\nfailed verification\n]\nThe organization's leaders \"vehemently reject\" Orthodox Jewish identity.\n[\n121\n]\nThe\nKabbalah Society\n, run by\nWarren Kenton\n, an organisation based instead on pre-Lurianic Medieval Kabbalah presented in universalist style. In contrast, traditional kabbalists read earlier kabbalah through later Lurianism and the systemisations of 16th-century Safed.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe New Kabbalah\n, website and books by Sanford L. Drob, is a scholarly intellectual investigation of the Lurianic symbolism in the perspective of modern and postmodern intellectual thought. It seeks a \"new kabbalah\" rooted in the historical tradition through its academic study, but universalised through dialogue with modern philosophy and psychology. This approach seeks to enrich the secular disciplines, while uncovering intellectual insights formerly implicit in kabbalah's essential myth:\n[\n122\n]\nBy being equipped with the nonlinear concepts of dialectical, psychoanalytic, and deconstructive thought we can begin to make sense of the kabbalistic symbols in our own time. So equipped, we are today probably in a better position to understand the philosophical aspects of the kabbalah than were the kabbalists themselves.\n[\n123\n]\nThe Kabbalah of Information is described in the 2018 book\nFrom Infinity to Man: The Fundamental Ideas of Kabbalah Within the Framework of Information Theory and Quantum Physics\nwritten by Ukrainian-born professor and businessman\nEduard Shyfrin\n. The main tenet of the teaching is \"In the beginning He created information\", rephrasing the famous saying of Nahmanides, \"In the beginning He created primordial matter and He didn't create anything else, just shaped it and formed it.\"\n[\n124\n]\nHasidic\n[\nedit\n]\nSince the 18th century, Jewish mystical development has continued in Hasidic Judaism, turning kabbalah into a social revival with texts that internalise mystical thought. Among different schools,\nChabad-Lubavitch\nand\nBreslav\nwith related organisations, give outward looking spiritual resources and textual learning for secular Jews. The Intellectual Hasidism of Chabad most emphasises the spread and understanding of kabbalah through its explanation in Hasidic thought, articulating the Divine meaning within kabbalah through human rational analogies, uniting the spiritual and material, esoteric and exoteric in their Divine source:\nHasidic thought instructs in the predominance of spiritual form over physical matter, the advantage of matter when it is purified, and the advantage of form when integrated with matter. The two are to be unified so one cannot detect where either begins or ends, for \"the Divine beginning is implanted in the end and the end in the beginning\" (Sefer Yetzira 1:7). The One God created both for one purpose – to reveal the holy light of His hidden power. Only both united complete the perfection desired by the Creator.\n[\n125\n]\nNeo-Hasidic\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nrelies largely or entirely on a\nsingle source\n.\nRelevant discussion may be found on the\ntalk page\n.

The writings and teachings of\nZalman Schachter-Shalomi\n,\nArthur Green\n,\nLawrence Kushner\n,\nHerbert Weiner\nand others, has sought a critically selective, non-fundamentalist neo- Kabbalistic and Hasidic study and\nmystical spirituality\namong modernist Jews. The contemporary proliferation of scholarship by\nJewish mysticism academia\nhas contributed to critical adaptions of Jewish mysticism. Arthur Green's translations from the religious writings of\nHillel Zeitlin\nconceive the latter to be a precursor of contemporary Neo-Hasidism. Reform rabbi Herbert Weiner's\nNine and a Half Mystics: The Kabbala Today\n(1969), a travelogue among Kabbalists and Hasidim, brought perceptive insights into Jewish mysticism to many Reform Jews. Leading Reform philosopher\nEugene Borowitz\ndescribed the Orthodox Hasidic\nAdin Steinsaltz\n(\nThe Thirteen Petalled Rose\n) and\nAryeh Kaplan\nas major presenters of Kabbalistic spirituality for modernists today.\n[\n126\n]\nRav Kook\n[\nedit\n]\nThe writings of Abraham Isaac Kook (1864–1935), first chief rabbi of Mandate Palestine and visionary, incorporate kabbalistic themes through his own poetic language and concern with human and divine unity. His influence is in the\nReligious Zionist\ncommunity, who follow his aim that the legal and imaginative aspects of Judaism should interfuse:\nDue to the alienation from the \"secret of God\" [i.e. Kabbalah], the higher qualities of the depths of Godly life are reduced to trivia that do not penetrate the depth of the soul. When this happens, the most mighty force is missing from the soul of nation and individual, and Exile finds favor essentially... We should not negate any conception based on rectitude and awe of Heaven of any form—only the aspect of such an approach that desires to negate the mysteries and their great influence on the spirit of the nation. This is a tragedy that we must combat with counsel and understanding, with holiness and courage.\n[\n127\n]\nCathar and Mandaean parallels\n[\nedit\n]\nMain article:\nMandaeism\nIn several important areas of his history of the Kabbalah,\nGershom Scholem\ninvestigates and considers the evidence of an interactivity of influence between the medieval Kabbalists of Provence and the\nCathar heresy\nwhich was also prevalent in the region at the same time that the earliest works of medieval Kabbalah were written.\n[\n128\n]\nIn\nJewish Influence on Christian Reform Movements\n,\nLouis I. Newman\nconcluded, \"Point by point, parallels can be found between Catharist views and the Kabbalah, and it may well be that at times there was an exchange of opinions between Jewish and Gentile mystics.\"\n[\n129\n]\nEarlier in the same book, Newman observed:\n…that the powerful Jewish culture in Languedoc, which had acquired sufficient strength to assume an aggressive, propagandist policy, created a milieu wherefrom movements of religious independence arose readily and spontaneously. Contact and association between Christian princes and their Jewish officials and friends stimulated the state of mind which facilitated the banishment of orthodoxy, the clearing away of the debris of Catholic theology. Unwilling to receive Jewish thought, the princes and laity turned towards Catharism, then being preached in their domains.\n[\n129\n]\nNathaniel Deutsch\nwrites:\nInitially, these interactions [between\nMandaeans\nand\nJewish mystics\nin Babylonia from Late Antiquity to the medieval period] resulted in shared magical and angelological traditions. During this phase the parallels which exist between\nMandaeism\nand\nHekhalot\nmysticism would have developed. At some point, both Mandaeans and Jews living in Babylonia began to develop similar cosmogonic and theosophic traditions involving an analogous set of terms, concepts, and images. At present it is impossible to say whether these parallels resulted primarily from Jewish influence on Mandaeans, Mandaean influence on Jews, or from cross fertilization. Whatever their original source, these traditions eventually made their way into the priestly – that is, esoteric – Mandaean texts ... and into the Kabbalah.\n[\n130\n]\n: 222\nR.J.

Since\nevery name which was given to God\nreferred to one of the characteristics or attributes by which He revealed Himself to His creatures, or which they ascribed to Him, there is no name or epithet for God from the point of view of His own being. Consequently, when the kabbalists wanted to be precise in their language they abstained from using names like\nElohim\n, the\nTetragrammaton\n, \"the Holy One, blessed be He,\" and others. These names are all found either in the\nWritten\nor the\nOral Law\n. The Torah, however, refers only to God's manifestations and not to God's own being which is above and beyond His relationship to the created world. Therefore, neither in the\nBible\n, nor in\nrabbinic tradition\nwas there a term which could fulfill the need of the kabbalists in their speculations on the nature of God. \"Know that\nEin-Sof\nis not alluded to either in the Pentateuch, the Prophets, or the Hagiographa, nor in the writings of the rabbis.

    "response": "Based on the extensive information from the Wikipedia article and core Kabbalistic concepts, here's how you can understand and use Kabbalah in your story:\n\n### Core Concepts of Kabbalah (Story-Ready Summary)\n1.  **Divine Emanations (Sefirot):**\n    *   The 10 Sefirot (e.g., Chesed-Kindness, Gevurah-Judgment, Tiferet-Beauty) represent the attributes/processes through which the infinite, unknowable God (Ein Sof) creates and interacts with the universe.\n    *   **Story Use:** Structure your world, magic system, or character archetypes around these attributes. A council of 10 beings? A character embodying a specific Sefirah (e.g., a harsh judge embodies Gevurah)? A hero needing to balance opposing Sefirot (Love vs. Justice)?\n\n2.  **Cosmic Drama (Tzimtzum, Shevirah, Tikkun):**\n    *   **Tzimtzum:** God \"contracted\" infinite light to make space for creation.\n    *   **Shevirah (\"Shattering\"):** Vessels meant to hold divine light shattered, scattering holy sparks and creating imbalance/evil (Kelipot - shells).\n    *   **Tikkun (\"Repair\"):** The purpose of existence is to \"raise the sparks\" and repair the cosmic damage through righteous acts, study, and intention.\n    *   **Story Use:** A foundational creation myth for your world. The central conflict could be repairing this primordial damage (e.g., collecting scattered sparks, battling manifestations of the broken shells/Kelipot). Characters could have roles tied to Tikkun.\n\n3.  **Mystical Interpretation:**\n    *   Kabbalah sees the Torah and Hebrew letters as encoded with infinite layers of hidden divine meaning. Everything is symbolic.\n    *   **Story Use:** Introduce a secret, mystical text in your world (like the Zohar). Have characters decipher hidden meanings in ancient scriptures or even the fabric of reality itself (names, numbers, symbols hold power). Your magic system could involve manipulating divine names or understanding cosmic codes.\n\n4.  **Soul & Reincarnation (Gilgul):**\n    *   The soul has complex layers (Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, etc.). Gilgul (transmigration) allows souls to return to complete their Tikkun.\n    *   **Story Use:** Character backstories involving past lives impacting the present. A character's \"higher soul\" guiding them. Quests tied to rectifying past-life mistakes. Different soul levels could be linked to magical aptitude.\n\n5.  **Divine Immanence & Panentheism:**\n    *   While transcendent (Ein Sof), God is also immanent within creation.
